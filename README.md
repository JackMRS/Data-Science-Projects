# This repository contains all my data science related academic projects done at UCLA. For all projects, I either lead the whole project or served as the data scientist/specialist in the team.

# The projects that represents my current skills and abilities are **8. Machine Learning** and **9. COVID Vaccine Approval Study**.

# So far this repository is loosely organized, but once I get a break from my schoolworks, it will be structured properly for future references. 
# Due to One Drive's synchronization issues, the source code of some project were lost. I've tried to recover as much data as possible.
