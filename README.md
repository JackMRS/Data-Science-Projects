# This repository contains all my Data Science related academic projects done at UCLA. For all these projects, I either lead the whole project or served as the data scientist/specialist in the team.
## The projects that represent my current skills and abilities are **8. Machine Learning** and **9. COVID Vaccine Approval Study**.
## So far, this repository is loosely organized, but once I get a break from my school works, it will be appropriately structured for future references. I may consider rewriting some of them if necessary.
## Due to One Drive's synchronization issues, the source codes of some projects were lost. I've tried to recover as much data as possible.
